# sub-sonic-converging-diverging-nozzle-cfd

CFD analysis of a converging-diverging nozzle under subsonic flow conditions using ANSYS Fluent
> Based on a tutorial by *The Engineering Guide*

---

## Objective

- Model a converging-diverging nozzle geometry
- Apply appropriate boundary conditions for subsonic flow
- Simulate internal flow using ANSYS Fluent
- Visualize velocity and pressure distributions in the nozzle

---

## Tools Used

- ANSYS Fluent 2024 R2 (Student Version)
- Google Drive (for sharing large files)
- GitHub (project versioning)

---

## Simulation File

Since the file is too large for GitHub, the full ANSYS Workbench project is available on Google Drive:

ðŸ”— [Download the ANSYS Project (.wbpz)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XmnmOS9rnuim8kfWkCBvGm7nDEVtet0Y/view?usp=sharing)


---

##  Notes

- Includes geometry, mesh, boundary setup, and solver settings
- Useful for learning internal compressible/incompressible flow analysis and comparison with calculations.
